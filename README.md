# HATPRO-DABINIO

## HATPRO Radiometer DAta BINary Input/Output Library

This is a static and dynamic Library to work with the binary data files of the [RPG GmbH](http://www.radiometer-physics.de) radiometer HATPRO.
This is a development for the [Geophysical Institute's](https://www.gfi.uib.no) research project ''Off-shore Boundary Layer Observatory ([OBLO](http://oblo.w.uib.no/))''. 

The Library contains a set of C++ classes to read the HATPRO binary data files and to write data files mimicing the radiometer's binary format. The library can be linked directly with C/C++ or Fortran 90 programs, or alternatively be linked by means of wrappers for scripting languages like Matlab, GNU/Octave or Python.

This repository contains simple examples to use the library from GNU/Octave and Matlab as mex functions.

## Usage
### Stand-alone

### GNU/Octave & MATLAB

### Wrapper for FORTRAN

## Compatibility
### Software
The library has been tested under Linux, for the __OpenSUSE Leap 14.3__ and __Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial__ distributions.

### Hardware
It has been used with HATPRO radiometer generation 4 (G4), any contribution or testing on other generations are wellcome.

## Copyright
The library is sitributed under GPLv3 License. See LICENSE.TXT for details.
